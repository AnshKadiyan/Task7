1.Open your browser’s extension/add-ons manager.
    -> Menu (⋮) → Extensions → Manage Extensions


2.Review all installed extensions carefully.
    -> Carefully looked at each extension name
    -> Checked:
        Purpose of the extension
        Whether I remember installing it
        Whether I actively use it
    Extensions I don’t recognize are treated as red flags.


3.Check permissions and reviews for each extension.
    ->For each extension:
        Reviewed permissions, such as:
            “Read and change all your data on all websites”
            “Access browsing history”
        Checked:
            Developer name
            User reviews
            Ratings and complaints
        Extensions with excessive permissions for simple tasks are suspicious.


4.Identify any unused or suspicious extensions.
    ->Indicators used:
        Not used in a long time
        Unknown developer
        Poor reviews
        Over-privileged permissions
        Installed automatically (bundled with software)


5.Remove suspicious or unnecessary extensions.
    -> Clicked Remove / Delete
    -> Confirmed removal


6.Restart browser and check for performance improvements.
    -> After restarting the browser:
        Observed:
            Faster page loading
            Reduced ads/pop-ups
            Lower memory usage
        This confirms the impact of removing unnecessary extensions.


7.Research how malicious extensions can harm users.
    -> Malicious browser extensions can:
            Steal cookies and session tokens
            Log keystrokes (passwords)
            Inject ads or redirect traffic
            Spy on browsing history
            Modify web content (phishing)
            Bypass security controls
            They often act silently in the background.


8.Document steps taken and extensions removed
    -> Opened extension manager
    -> Reviewed all installed extensions
    -> Checked permissions and reviews
    -> Identified unused/suspicious extensions
    -> Removed unnecessary extensions
    -> Restarted browser and verified performance
    -> Researched risks of malicious extensions
